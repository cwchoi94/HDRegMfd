# HDRegMfd

The goal of \code{HDRegMfd} is to develop high-dimensional linear regression
tools for Hilbert manifold-valued data. This package has been implemented for
Euclidean, simplex, sphere, SPD matrices with log-Euclidean metric, functional, BayesHilbert, and Wasserstein
space-valued data.

## Installation

You can install this package from GitHub.

```{r}

# devtools::install_github(paste0("cwchoi94/HDRegMfd"))
