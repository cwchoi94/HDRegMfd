# HDRegMfd

The goal of is to develop high-dimensional linear regression tools for
Hilbert manifold-valued data. This package has been implemented for
Euclidean, simplex, sphere, SPD matrices with log-Euclidean metric,
functional, BayesHilbert, and Wasserstein space-valued data.

## Installation

You can install this package from GitHub.
