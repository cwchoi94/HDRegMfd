# HDRegMfd

The goal of this package is to develop high-dimensional regression tools
for Hilbert manifold-valued data. This package has been implemented for
Euclidean, simplex, sphere, SPD matrices with log-Euclidean and
affine-invariant metric, functional, BayesHilbert, and Wasserstein
space-valued data.

## Installation

You can install this package from GitHub.

``` r

# devtools::install_github(paste0("cwchoi94/HDRegMfd"))
```

## Usage

This package consists of three high-dimensional regression models: LM,
GLM, QM and AM.
